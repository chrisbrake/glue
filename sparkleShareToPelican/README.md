# Connecting Sparkle Share to Pelican.
## Context
I'll be using [Pelican](https://github.com/getpelican) to build blog pages for me based on markdown files that I feed to it.
And I don't really want to send the files by hand, (like an animal).

Something was going to handle this task for me, and I decided on [SparkleShare](https://github.com/hbons/SparkleShare).  It gives me version tracking, It doens't store my data in anyone's cloud, and it has clients on Windows, Mac, and Linux. 

#The Problem
The SparkleShare "Host" machine only stores a Git bare repo, and Pelican can't read that.

#The Solution
I'll fill this out once I have a working model.
